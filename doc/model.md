# Geometric Optics - Model Description

The simulation describes light propagation through a lens in
terms of rays. The rays in 
geometric optics are useful abstraction useful for approximating the paths 
along which light propagates.

The index of refraction of the lens is given by
f= R/(2(1-n))) where n and R are respectively the index of refraction and the radius of curvature of the lens. 

The position of the image is determined in the thin lens approximation, i.e.
1/d_o+1/d_i = 1/f 
where d_o is the distance to the object, d_i is the distance to the image 
and f is the focal length of the lens. 

The principal rays mode denote three rays that help identify the position of the image. There are defined by three rays 

- A ray from the top of the object proceeding parallel to the optical axis of the lens. Beyond the lens, it will pass through the principal focal point. For a negative lens, it will proceed from the lens as if it emanated from the focal point on the near side of the lens.
- A ray through the center of the lens, which will be undeflected. 
- A ray through the principal focal point on the near side of the lens. It will proceed parallel to the centerline upon exit from the lens.

The marginal rays are the rays that start at the object and and touch the edge of the lens.

The lenses are considered to be ideal and free of spherical and comatic aberrations.
